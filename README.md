5. **Templatisation Service:** Handles templates for customized notifications.
6. **User Service:** Manages user-related data and operations.
7. **Billing Service:** Tracks user billing and payments.
8. **Ledger Service:** Maintains all transaction data for users.
9. **Reporting Service:** Generates detailed reports on spending behavior.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Redis:** In-memory data structure store for caching.
- **RabbitMQ:** Message broker for asynchronous microservice communication.
- **Docker:** Containerization for consistent and easy deployment.
- **Kafka:** Distributed streaming platform for real-time data pipelines.
- **Kubernetes:** Orchestrates and manages containerized applications.
